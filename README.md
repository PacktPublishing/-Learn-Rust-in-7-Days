# Learn Rust in 7 Days [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learn Rust in 7 Days [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-rust-7-days-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789805499), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The course is split into seven parts, which give you a complete overview of why Rust is a great programming language. In the first couple of days, you’ll learn to install Rust on your system, discover its syntax, and see a library that utilizes the feature of trait-based generics and code reusability. 

By the end of the course, you’ll have built a mini-bank application that tracks users’ financial transactions over time, allowing them to view their history over time.
